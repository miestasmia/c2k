# c2k

c2k is an X11 application for playing keyboard & mouse-only games with a game controller.

Currently supports multiple games on the PlayStation DualShock 3 controller, however more games (and hopefully controllers) will be added later.

Please refer to [the wiki](https://github.com/miestasmia/c2k/wiki) for a list of controls.

Modify `controllers.json` and the `*.json` files in the `bindings` directory to add support for custom controllers and/or applications.
